# CodeLibrary

Contains some of my small working projects in C++. Mostly used for sharing my own projects between computers.

Currently contains:
- BasicGameEngine: Stripped down version of TiFrame (https://github.com/Tdead1/TiFrame)
- Pathfinding: A fast (and working) Binary Heap A* pathfinder
- Utility: A C++ Utility decision making system optimized for high quantities of units.
